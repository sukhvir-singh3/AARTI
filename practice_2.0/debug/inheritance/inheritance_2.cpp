/*
1) The Cat constructor now calls the Animal constructor to correctly initialize the m_name variable.

2) The makeSound function in Cat has the override keyword to indicate that it is overriding the makeSound function in Animal.

3) We use dynamic casting to cast the Animal pointer to a Cat pointer, which will give us a valid cat pointer if the Animal object is actually a Cat. We also check if the cast was successful before calling the makeSound method.

4) We have used the virtual keyword for the makeSound method in the base class to ensure that the derived class implementation is called when we have a pointer to the base class.

5) We have added a delete statement to properly free the memory allocated for the animal object.
